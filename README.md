# Raw-Housing-Price-Dashboard-

Excited to unveil my latest project: the Raw Housing Price Dashboard created with Power BI! 

I've leveraged data from Kaggle to develop a comprehensive tool for analyzing housing market trends. Here’s what you can explore:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Dive into Total Selling Price (YTD, last year, MTD, QTD), Total Houses Sold, Average Price, Maximum Price, and Minimum Price trends.

Interactive Slicers: Drill down by year, waterfront view, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, month, visit history, and house age to uncover detailed insights.

Visual Insights: Explore trends with interactive visualizations, including:

Stacked Bar Charts: Total Houses Sold by Quarter, Sale Price by Number of Floors.
Stacked Column Charts: Sale Price by Age of House (in Years), Sale Price by Month, Sale Price by Day.
Pie Chart: Distribution of House Conditions.
Top Performers: Identify top houses by customer ID, sale price, bathrooms, floors, and bedrooms to understand market outliers and trends.

This dashboard isn’t just about numbers; it’s a tool to understand the pulse of the housing market in real-time. Whether you’re a real estate professional, investor, or data enthusiast, this dashboard provides actionable insights.
